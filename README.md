# A basic Tokyo Cabinet shell for the browser (and a little homage to _why)

## NOTE: This project is still work in progress ##

## Summary ##

Since Redis and Mongodb already has nice in-browser shell, we built this as part of Eden Development & New Bamboo Joint hack day.

This is literally the rip off from [Try.Mongo](http://github.com/banker/mongulator).

* Implement more features of tch and tcb
* Add tutorial
